1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server Database.  
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.  
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.  


## 📖 Project Overview

This project includes the following components:

1. **Data Architecture**: Modern warehouse design using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.  
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extract, Transform, Load processes to move data from source systems into the data warehouse.  
3. **Data Modeling**: Creation of fact and dimension tables for analytical workloads.  
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: SQL-based reports and dashboards for business insights.
